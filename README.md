## About the Video Course
The video will take you through the process of learning how to build a simple 3D game UI with simple game logic. This way we can focus on the aspects of developing and mastering Unityâ€™s UI system while allowing you to adapt and use the techniques to develop your own games. We will use a combination of each of the canvas types (Overlay/Camera/World) so as to better demonstrate their usage in the context of building a game. 

This course takes you step-by-step in a tutorial-based approach, diving deep into the entire Unity UI system. It will walk you through core components which will enable you to build exciting games using Unity. We will be taking a practical approach by including ample examples of building practical User Interfaces, exploring the inner workings of the unity UI ecosystem. With these examples, you will understand how to use different UI components to trigger game events and respond to user input.
